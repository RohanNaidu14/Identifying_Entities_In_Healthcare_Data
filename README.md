# Identifying_Entities_In_Healthcare_Data

**Suppose you have been given such a data set in which a lot of text is written related to the _medical domain_. You can see in the dataset, there are a lot of diseases that can be mentioned in the entire dataset and their related treatments are also mentioned implicitly in the text.
Note that _it is not explicitly mentioned_ in the dataset about the diseases and their treatment, but somehow, you can build an algorithm to map the diseases and their respective treatment.**

You can determine the disease name and its probable treatment from the dataset and list it out in the form of a table or a dictionary like this. 👇🏼
