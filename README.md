# Identifying_Entities_In_Healthcare_Data

**Suppose you have been given such a data set in which a lot of text is written related to the medical domain. As you can see in the dataset, there are a lot of diseases that can be mentioned in the entire dataset and their related treatments are also mentioned implicitly in the text, which you saw in the aforementioned example that the disease mentioned is cancer and its treatment can be identified as chemotherapy using the sentence.
But, note that it is not explicitly mentioned in the dataset about the diseases and their treatment, but somehow, you can build an algorithm to map the diseases and their respective treatment.**
